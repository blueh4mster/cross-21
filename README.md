# CROSS-21

Cross-chain interoperability enables applications to communicate and interact with each other across different blockchain networks. This allows for the transfer of data and value between disparate systems, providing increased connectivity and seamless integration.
Blockchain interoperability protocols are important for the Web3 ecosystem and traditional systems that need to interact with different blockchains. These protocols are the foundation for building blockchain abstraction layers, allowing traditional backends and dApps to interact with any blockchain network through a single middleware solution. Without a blockchain interoperability protocol, Web2 systems and dApps would need to build separate in-house implementations for each cross-chain interaction that they want to use, which is a time-consuming, resource-intensive, and complex process.

Blockchain interoperability protocols provide the following capabilities:

- You can transfer assets and information across multiple blockchains.
- Application developers can leverage the strengths and benefits of different chains.
- Collaboration between developers from diverse blockchain ecosystems enables the building of cross-chain applications to serve more users and provide additional features or products for them

Cross 21 is an implementation of the above mentioned application of cross chain interoperability protocol in the field of gaming.

Cross 21 allows players from different chains to interact with each other in a simple play of "game 21", it uses CCIP protocol by chainlink which allows token transfers along with message sending and receiving in order to communicate the moves of the play across different chains.

CCIP allows interoperability between Web3 games across multiple different blockchains, which enables players on one chain to play a game against players on another chain.

From a developer's perspective, each deployment constitutes an isolated and independent instance, resulting in the backend contracts being unconnected and unaware of each other. For example, a decentralized exchange (DEX) DApp may need to be deployed on Ethereum, BNB Chain, and Polygon networks individually. It leads to each version of the DApps being isolated.
